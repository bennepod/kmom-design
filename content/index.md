<h2>This is a page about me and my journey through my studies and some other stuff.</h2>

My name is Ben. I am just an average male with no real idea what to
do with their life. There was always a lot of things I wished for
in life, but I could never really figure out what to do in terms of
work. I am a simple man, with many intrests and hobbies, but it
has been proven quite difficult to figure out how to be econimically
stable when my body never approved of my job of choise. I have a
degree in ecology and animal behaviour, but I struggle a lot with
allergies and chronic pain which makes life in general rough. So
trying to figure out a way to have stable economy and be able to 
pay for my hobbies so that I can keep doing what I love. 

Travel and seeing the world, create new worlds and write stories,
listen to music and perhaps make some of my own, play guitar and piano,
sing, and maybe play some videogames in-between. It is hard in this
day and age to find good jobs that pays well if you are somewhat 
inpacable of working repetative or somewhat physical jobs. The struggle
when ones mental health keeps plummeting rapidly whenever one try to
work a full-time job, not to meantion the struggle with chronic pain
and inflammation in the muscles and ligaments which does not help much.

My goal for now is to learn new things, and figure out ways to have
a stable income with something I can work with and still have time and
energy to do what i love. Do not get me wrong, I do find programming
interesing, but at some point it would be cool to publish my own book
or even my own bookseries.  

Peace out for now!
